# Python Project Documentation

## Introduction

This Python project serves as an interactive interface between users and specialized agents for executing Python code. It leverages the OpenAI API to create and manage conversational threads, enabling users to interact with AI agents seamlessly.

## Project Components

### 1. OpenAI Integration

The project utilizes the OpenAI API to create and manage agents, threads, and execute Python code. The `openai` library is imported for this purpose.

### 2. Custom Print Function

The `wprint` function is a custom print function that wraps text to a specified width. This function is designed to enhance the readability of output messages.

### 3. Get Completion Function

The `get_completion` function is a crucial component responsible for executing a thread based on a provided message. It interacts with an OpenAI assistant, triggers the execution of functions defined in the `funcs` parameter, and retrieves the completion result.

### 4. Code Execution Classes

#### a. ExecutePyFile Class

This class is a part of the project's toolset and represents a function to execute an existing Python file from the local disk. It includes a `run` method for executing the Python script and capturing its output and errors.

#### b. File Class

The `File` class represents a Python file with a specified name and contents. The `run` method writes the provided body to the file.

### 5. User Proxy and Communication

The project includes a `user_proxy` agent responsible for streamlining communication between users and specialized agents. The `SendMessage` class allows the user proxy to send messages to other specialized agents within the group chat.

### 6. Main Execution Loop

The project includes a main execution loop that continuously prompts the user for input, processes the input using the `get_completion` function, and prints the resulting message.

## Usage Instructions

1. Run the main Python script.
2. Input messages in the user prompt to interact with the user proxy and specialized agents.
3. The user proxy communicates with the specialized agents to fulfill user requests, executing Python code as needed.

## Dependencies

- `openai`: The OpenAI Python library for interacting with the OpenAI API.
- `instructor`: A custom library for managing OpenAI assistant tools.
- `getpass`: Standard library module for securely inputting the OpenAI API key.
